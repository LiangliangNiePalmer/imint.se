Imint has a solid track record in providing software solutions to improve capabilities in aerial ISR missions, from its introduction of the Ihvert® product in 2009. Imint focused on enhancing live aerial surveillance video streams by removing obstacles for human perception, caused by disturbances, such as uncontrollable movements, vibration and turbulence. This inspired the development of Imint's Vidhance® technology. Today, most customers choose the Vidview™ path, as it brings in the capabilities of Vidhance into practically any ground software.

# Improve Detection and Recognition Capabilities on the Ground

{{<img src="img/solutions/aerial-surveillance-and-uas/uas-fog.jpg" class="small-image floatright">}}Vidview is ideal for using as the video viewer inside a Ground Control Station (GCS) or Remote Video Terminal (RVT) for unmanned aerial systems (UAS), or RPAS. Vidview provides a number of real-time vision enhancement and video analytics functions through the underlying live video [Vidhance](http://vidhance.com "Vidhance") technology. Visibility problems like turbulence, vibrations, fog, mist, and other bad weather conditions, as well as uneven illumination, sun-glare, etc., all reduce the effectiveness of the mission, and will reduce operator alertness over time.Addressing these kind of issues on the sensor side (EO and IR cameras) also comes with drawbacks, as it adds both weight and cost to the flying platform.  The more that can be achieved on the ground, the better.

{{<img src="img/solutions/aerial-surveillance-and-uas/20131009-dsc_1159_0.jpg" class="small-image floatright">}}In addition to boost a GCS, an RVT, or a video PED system (processing, exploitation and dissemination), Vidview is also very suitable as an enhanced video viewer in intelligence dissemination centers and command -and control rooms, making the most out of ISR video. Whenever decision is based in part on time critical video feeds, Vidview can provide that extra visibility boost needed.

# More Than Just Improved Vision

Vidview also provides useful video analytics functions, such as object tracking. Thus Vidview is more than a "smart" enhanced video player, as its feedback also can be used for sensor control in "lock on target" scenarios. It offers more than a video stabilizer or video contrast enhancement box. It also enables creation of text and graphic overlays, including those responding to user interaction. A Vidview video viewer can be delivered with a SDK (Software Development Kit) to enable smooth integration into a host application. Different levels of integration is possible, from tight through development in a .NET environment, to providing ActiveX COM-interfaces, or simply by remote control of a Vidview application through TCP/IP. (Most of the code in the Vidview SDK is currently written in c# for .net.)

Integration of Vidview into a host application, such as a GCS or RVT is made easy through the [Vidview SDK](/imint.se/vidview/vidview-sdk "Vidview SDK") (Software Development Kit).

Vidview is used by leading UAS providers, such as Bluebird Aero Systems, Innocon and Elbit Systems.
