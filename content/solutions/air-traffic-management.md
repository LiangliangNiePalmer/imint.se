# Improve Safety and Efficiency in Video-based ATM [Problem with header](Problem)

Air traffic control is more reliant on video than ever, and an airport sees more and more cameras being installed for both traffic control, but also for security and perimeter protection purposes. However, weather and video visibility might not always be favorable. Applying a software solution where video is being viewed offers substantial cost reduction opportunities over video camera upgrades.<!--more-->

Vidview™ is ideal for using as the video viewer in video based air control towers, or remote traffic control or observation in Remote and Virtual Towers (RVT). Vidview is equally a good companion to airport video surveillance systems. Vidview provides a number of real-time vision enhancement and live video analytic functions, such as object tracking, through the underlying live video Vidhance® technology.

{{<img src="img/solutions/air-traffic-management/atm-imint-sno.jpg" class="">}}Vidhance was originally developed for live aerial surveillance scenarios and to provide better decision support capabilities when relying on video from harsh environments. Visibility problems from fog, mist, and other bad weather conditions, as well as uneven illumination, sun-glare, etc., and even shakiness from mast mounted cameras, all reduce the effectiveness of air traffic management, and will reduce traffic controller alertness over time.

In addition to video-based air traffic control, Vidview is also very suitable as an enhanced video viewer for more broader video surveillance purposes on and near airfields and airports. Whenever decision is based in part on time critical video feeds, Vidview can provide that extra visibility boost needed. Vidview improves visibility at the place for human viewing, thus providing a substantial cost advantage compared to upgrading a large number of video cameras for achieving the same goal.

# More Than Just Improved Vision

Vidhance also provides useful video analytics functions, such as aircraft tracking. Thus Vidview is more than a "smart" video player, as its feedback also can be used for camera control in "lock and follow" scenarios. The Vidhance tracker is tuned to follow objects that change in size and shape, and is thus well suited to follow inbound/outbound aircraft and vehicles moving on the airport surface.

Vidview also enables creation of text and graphic overlays, including those responding to user interaction. Vidview can be delivered with a SDK (Software Development Kit) to enable smooth integration into a host application. Different levels of integration is possible, from tight through development in a .NET environment, to providing ActiveX COM-interfaces, or simply by remote control of a Vidview application through TCP/IP. Integration of Vidview into a host application, such as air traffic control software, is made easy through a Vidview SDK (Software Development Kit)
