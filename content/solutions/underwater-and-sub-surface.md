{{<img src="img/solutions/underwater-and-sub-surface/uw-rov.jpg" class="small-image floatright">}}Remotely controller underwater robots (ROVs) has become an essential tool in deep sea operations, pipeline and other sub-sea infrastructure inspections, sea floor construction, sub surface rescue operations, etc. Even when equipped with good underwater cameras and lamps (such as underwater LED lights), the sea environment can severely challenge visibility with sometimes murky waters.

Vidview is ideal for using as the video viewer inside a an operator panel or console for underwater robots and systems, unmanned as for ROVs, UWV, or AUVs, or manned submarines.<!--more--> Vidview provides a number of real-time vision enhancement and video analytics functions through the underlying live video Vidhance technology. The extreme low latency enables operator-in-the-loop control. The all-software approach, and the integration possibilities into standard user interfaces in operator consoles, decrease both system complexity and increase flexibility, as old-style dedicated video enhancement hardware is obsoleted. The scene-adaptive local contrast optimization found in Vidhance has proven very useful in subsurface video, as it dramatically improves visibility in murky waters, at the same time as effects of uneven illumination and particle reflections is reduced.

# More Than Just Improved Underwater Vision

Vidview also provides useful video analytics functions, such as object tracking. Thus Vidview is more than a "smart" video player, as its feedback also can be used for sensor or motor control in "lock on target" scenarios. As an example, the tracking output parameters can be used to make a ROV hover at a designated location during inspection. Vidview also enables creation of text and graphic overlays, including those responding to user interaction. Vidview can be delivered with a SDK (Software Development Kit) to enable smooth integration into a host application.{{<img src="img/solutions/underwater-and-sub-surface/uw-blandat_282-545x405.jpg" class="small-image floatright">}}


The image shows Vidview with Vidhance running in the Swedish Royal Navy's Submarine Rescue Vehicle. The project was presented by Imint at the Undersea Defense Technology conference (UDT) in 2013. [Contact us](Contact "Contact") and request a copy of the presentation white paper, and we would be happy to share it.

Different levels of integration is possible, from tight through development in a .NET environment, to providing Active X COM-interfaces, or simply by remote control of a Vidview application through TCP/IP. Integration of Vidview into a host application, such as a ROV operator console, is made easy through a Vidview SDK (Software Development Kit).

Find out more on [Vidview](Vidview "Vidview") and the [Vidhance](Vidhance "Vidhance") technology. You are very welcome to [contact us](/imint.se/about/contact/ "Contact") for further questions, or for the opportunity to test drive Vidview. We encourage you to proceed to our [evaluation request form](/imint.se/form/evaluation-request "Evaluation Request"). We can also provide a technical white paper on Vidview integration into sub-surface systems.
