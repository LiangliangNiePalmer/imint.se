{{<img src="img/solutions/portable-consumer-devices/phone_photography.jpg" class="small-image floatright">}}The smartphone market has seen a technology race in terms of camera performance, mirrored by popular social media sites and photo applications. Market leading devices are now capable of near-professional still photography, and investments are being made in both optical- and electronic hardware stabilization technologies. This has led to sharper still photography in more challenging situations, and also to some improvements in video capture. However, Imint's conclusion is that a game-changing, revolutionary rather than evolutionary, incremental technology step needs to be taken to turn consumer hand-held video cameras from toys with short-lived interest, to something useful and truly capable.

The VidhanceÂ® software platform will enable such a leap, bringing short-term benefits to video capture quality, and will also provide the intelligent analytics platform on which to build future innovations in camera usage, leveraging the benefits of high resolution sensors.

{{<img src="img/solutions/portable-consumer-devices/iphone4s_video.png" class="small-image floatright">}}Smartphones and tablets are not designed to be ideal filming devices; their physical form factor and weight makes hand-held video unstable to the level of uselessness after only a few seconds. Imint has shown in experiments with two leading Smartphone brands - the Apple iPhone 5s, and the Samsung Galaxy S4 - that significant quality improvements can be achieved by applying the Vidhance software algorithms.The tests were done off-line, with prerecorded video, but representing real-time, on-device behavior of the algorithms.The results are extremely demonstrative, showing that we are at the verge of a new era in consumer-made video.

{{<img src="img/solutions/portable-consumer-devices/xy-galaxy.png" class="small-image floatright">}}Vidhance, which embeds patented methods for real-time video stabilization, is unique in its analytics approach, as it uses only video data to provide movement compensation. Other techniques rely on physical motion sensors, tying the possible improvements to physical constraints. As an example, the performance of Vidhance is not reduced when digital zoom is applied, which would otherwise magnify instability linear to the level of zoom applied.  The improvement that Vidhance brings to mobile video can be applied to improving the quality of video calls, and enable even more meaningful use of the HD video that consumers are now able to capture -  but not appreciate - to its full promise.

Another recent experiment conducted by Imint showed that applying Vidhance stabilization to hand-held video could significantly reduce the size of the encoded and compressed video. Traditional methods of video compression, which primarily encodes the difference between frames, yields poor results when the whole scenery is in motion, as is the case for unstable on-the-go filming.
