{{<img src="img/solutions/ground-vehicles-ugvs-and-robots/too long file name.jpg" class="halfwidth floatright">}}A remote controlled robot (or unmanned ground vehicle, UGV) is making its way to defuse and dispose a suspected bomb/eod. Vision is impaired due to robot vibrations, smoke and dust, making the delicate task more daunting. The same visibility challenges are found in other UGV or ROV (remotely operated vehicle) missions, such as robot search and rescue, where motion shakiness, bad weather, artificial illumination and similar factors reduce the robot operator's abilities to carry out the task.

[Vidview](Vidview "Vidview") is ideal for using as the video viewer in an operator panel or console for unmanned ground vehicles and ground robots. Vidview provides a number of real-time vision enhancement and video analytics functions through the underlying live video [Vidhance](Vidhance "Vidhance") technology<!--more-->, meeting these typical challenges for a ground robot system:

- Harsh filming conditions.
- Real-time, low latency needs for operator-in-the-loop
- Time-critical decision making under preassure
- Camera limitations (cost & weight)
- Resource constrained hardware for operator consoles (rugged laptops)

The extreme low latency of Vidhance enables operator-in-the-loop control, supporting demanding tasks such as EOD disposal. The all-software approach, and the integration possibilities into standard user interfaces in operator consoles, decrease both system complexity and increase flexibility, as old-style dedicated video enhancement hardware is obsoleted. The scene-adaptive local contrast optimization found in Vidhance has proven very useful in UGV video, as it dramatically improves visibility in low contrast scenarios (from smoke or rain), and reduces the negative effect of strong artificial illumination, such as reflections and off-light-cone black-outs. The powerful three degrees image stabilization (planar, rotational, and z-axis) also provides significant visibility improvements when controlling a vehicle in motion.

# Adding Operator Capabilities Regardless of Mission

Whether the robot mission is military (such as EOD disposal) or reconnaissance, or civilian inspection of infrastructure, in search-and-rescue missions or first responder operations, adding Vidview to the operator station will increase mission effectiveness. In addition, it is wise to keep both cost and weight of sensors and cameras low on the vehicle, as they operate in harsh environments. Vidview provides increased visual capabilities where it is needed - in front of the operator.

Vidview also provides useful video analytics functions, such as object tracking. Thus Vidview is more than a "smart" video player, as its feedback also can be used for sensor or motor control in "lock on target" scenarios or for more autonomous vehicle operation.

# More Than Just Improved Vision

Vidview also enables creation of text and graphic overlays, including those responding to user interaction. Vidview can be delivered with a SDK (Software Development Kit) to enable smooth integration into a host application. Different levels of integration is possible, from tight through development in a .NET environment, to providing Active X COM-interfaces, or simply by remote control of a Vidview application through TCP/IP. Integration of Vidview into a host application, such as an UGV operator console, is made easy through the [Vidview SDK](Vidview SDK "Vidview SDK") (Software Development Kit).
