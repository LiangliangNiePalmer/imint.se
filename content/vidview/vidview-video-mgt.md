A Vidviewâ„¢ video viewer is primarily an enabling platform for the [Vidhance](http://vidhance.com "Vidhance") technology, but is also provides a number of useful video management and video viewing functionality. This allows high level of customization for integration, as well as it saves valuable development time for standard functionality in any video viewing application.

# User Interaction

Vidview comes with functionality to interact with the video viewer, whether or not the video is playing or paused, such as:

- Panning
- Zooming
- Rotation
- Taking snapshots (save original and enhanced snapshots, including time stamps)

This can all be achieved seamlessly and convenient through, for example, mouse button interaction.

# Video Presentation

The way the video is presented in the Vidview viewer can be defined through functions like:

- Cropping of borders (size of crop can be set individually for each border)
- Setting of aspect ratio
- De-interlacing of video

# Video Capture and Input

Vidview allows for viewing and recording live video as well as video from file.

### *Live Analog Capture*

A number of analog capture devices are supported, such as Hauppage USB-LIVE-2, AVerMedia DVD EZMaker 7, and Sensoray 2253. Additional capture devices are also supported, and new devices can be supported upon request.
