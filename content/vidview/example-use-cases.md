{{<img src="img/vidview/operator_alert_1.jpg" class="small-image floatright">}}In practice, the potential list of suitable products for integration is close to endless. Under our [Solutions](/imint.se/solutions/ "Solutions") heading, a few application areas are presented in more detail. Use of video cameras to support human perception is in constant increase, in domain as varied as defense systems for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), public and governmental safety programs, machine- and equipment control and safety, infrastructure inspection and surveillance, commercial surveillance in industries such as transport, retail, energy and property.
This list is provided for the purpose of providing ideas, based on our past experience in integration projects.

- [Ground Control Stations for UAV's](/imint.se/solutions/aerial-surveillance-and-uas "Aerial Surveillance and UAS") / Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS)
- Control units for Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) such as [mine disposal ground robots](/imint.se/solutions/ground-vehicles-ugvs-and-robots "Ground Vehicles UGVs and Robots") or [underwater inspection ROVs](/imint.se/solutions/underwater-and-sub-surface "Underwater and Sub-surface").
- Integrated Security Systems software - systems for enterprise level integration, storage, analysis and presentation of multiple data sources, such as surveillance video camera streams, access control, alarms, fire detection, etc.
- Man-Machine Interfaces (MMI) and operator consoles for vehicles and equipment guided or controlled through video, such as onboard display computers.
- Control- and operations room environments, where video from a range of sources is received, disseminated and analyzed by one or many operators, guards, security personnel or intelligence officers. Control room settings are found in many domain, from traffic inspection, [air traffic management](/imint.se/solutions/air-traffic-management "Air Traffic Management"), critical infrastructure surveillance such airport security, police and fire fighting command centrals, etc.
- Defense mission intelligence, image analysis and ISR systems, where a multitude of full motion video (FMV) streams are fused with other type of data for real time situational awareness.
