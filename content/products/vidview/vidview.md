Vidviewâ„¢ allows programmers to easily integrate live video viewing and recording into their software applications, and take advantage of efficient real-time video enhancement.

Use cases is practically unlimited - any system using and relying on live video for monitoring, inspection or control can increase capabilities through Vidview. As examples, a control unit for underwater vehicles can give the operator better underwater vision, and a system receiving video from an aerial video camera can present clear and stabilized imagery in a ground control station (GCS) or remote video terminal (RVT). A security guard in a control room can immediately see through fog and mist in the surveillance viewing panels. As air traffic management is getting more reliant on live video, Vidview has found its place also in airport towers. Read more in our Example Use Cases.

{{< img src="img/products/vidview/urf-integration_thumb.jpg" class="small-image floatright">}}Applications using Vidview can benefit from Vidhance video enhancement by simply installing the appropriate Vidhance components. Vidhance components equip any system with unparalleled capabilities for real time visibility enhancement, excelling especially in harsh filming conditions. It also enables creation of text and graphic overlays, including those responding to user interaction.

Integration into other applications is made easy through a Vidview SDK (Software Development Kit), available today for .net development environments. Integration can be achieved on different levels, and a Vidview application can also be remotely controlled over tcp/ip.


{{< img src="img/products/vidview/20131009-dsc_1159.jpg" class="small-image floatright">}}Due to constant development, Vidhance technology is successively extended by novel and increased functionality. Moreover, Imint's Vidhance development team is well experienced in creating custom-tailored features.

While Vidview may be distributed to end users free of charge, Imint charges for Vidhance components. By cherry-picking Vidhance components, based on a customer's special requirements and budget, competitive solutions can be offered in every situation. End users who did not buy any Vidhance components initially, are able to purchase these later as feature upgrades.
